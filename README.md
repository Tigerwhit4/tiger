  * -m - Slow mode off 
  * +f - Followers only mode on 
  * -f - Followers only mode off 
  * +s - Subscribers only mode off

###  Custom, Custom Repeat, and Custom Scheduled

  * !command add [name] [text] - Ops - Creates an info command (!name) 
  * !command delete [name] - Ops - Removes info command (!name) 
  
  
  * !repeat add [name] [delay in seconds] [message difference - optional] 
  * !repeat delete [name]
  * !repeat list

The repeat command will repeat a custom trigger every X amount of seconds passed. Message difference allows you to prevent spamming an inactive channel. It requires Y amount of messages have passed in the channel since the last iteration of the message. The default is 1 so at least one message will need to have been sent in the channel in order for the repeat to trigger.

  * !schedule add [name] [pattern] [message difference - optional]
  * !schedule delete [name]
  * !schedule list

Schedule is similar to repeat but is designed to repeat at specific times such as 5pm, hourly (on the hour), semihourly (on 0:30), etc. `pattern` accepts: hourly, semihourly, and [crontab syntax**](http://i.imgur.com/j4t8CcM.png).

Examples:

    !schedule add youtube hourly 0 -- This will repeat the !youtube command every hour on the hour.
    !schedule add ip *_*_*_*_* 0 -- This will repeat the !ip command every minute.
    !schedule add texture *_5_*_*_* 0 -- This will repeat the !texture at 5am every day.

\*\* **Replace the spaces in crontab syntax with _**

### String Replacement

Adding dynamic data to bot message is also supported via string substitutions. The following substitutions are available:

  * (\_GAME\_) : Twitch game
  * (\_STATUS\_) : Twitch status
  * (\_VIEWERS\_) : Viewer count
  * (\_CHATTERS\_) : Number of users in chat
  * (\_STEAM\_PROFILE\_) : Link to Steam profile (Steam account must be configured)
  * (\_STEAM\_GAME\_) : Steam game (Steam account must be configured)
  * (\_STEAM\_SERVER\_) : Server you are playing on with a compatible (ie SteamWorks) game (Steam account must be configured)
  * (\_STEAM\_STORE\_) : Link to Steam store for the game you are playing (Steam account must be configured)
  * (\_SONG\_) : Scrobbled Last.fm track name and artist (Last.fm account must be configured)

  Example:
  !command add info I am (\_PROFILE\_) and I'm playing (\_STEAM\_GAME\_) on (\_STEAM\_SERVER\_) listening to (\_SONG\_)

  Output:
  I am http://bit.ly/321nds and I'm playing FTL: Faster Than Light on (none) listening to Wings of Destiny by David Saulesco
